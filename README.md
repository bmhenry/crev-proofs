# `crev-proofs`

This repo contains "proofs" for Rust crates that I personally have reviewed, as well as "trusts" indicating other users
whose reviews I trust.


## About

The `crev` repo can be found [here](https://github.com/crev-dev/crev).

I use [cargo-crev](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev) for Rust crate review.
